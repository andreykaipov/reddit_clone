To create a Rails app, we issue the command
	$ rails _4.x.x_ new the_apps_name

We can generate controllers for our Rails app with:
	$ rails generate controller static_pages

If we made a mistake, we can undo our generation by
	$ rails destroy controller static_pages

The routes file is responsible for implementing the router that defines the correspondence between URLs and web pages.
