This website acts as a Twitter clone, and was created to learn the basics of web development.

The title of this website is a portmanteau of the words write and anything.

This website was made using Ruby on Rails.

I used Michael Hartl's Tutorial as a guide to help me through the process.

Whenever I want to learn something new with Rails, I use this website as a playground.
